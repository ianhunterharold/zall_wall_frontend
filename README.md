Idea:

Zillow Group has an internal social network that allows visability into the complex social relationships in the workspace. You can see how people write about themselves, who is giving who karma (praise for doing a job well done, and specifically on what projects/work assignments) and what are your collegues' interests. I emulated this idea with all of the skills and knowledge aquired during my 15 week intensive full stack bootcamp at Flatiron school. 


To Install:

```
1. npm install 
2. npm start
3. your default local host port should already be connected with the server. your terminal should prompt you with a question like ' would you like to use another port '(y/n). type y
4. if you have set up the server correctly and the front end you should see this image. 
```

```
5. once at login page, seed data in server repository has passwords and usernames. 
to quickly login, username - ianhunter@gmail.com and password - abcabc 
```
